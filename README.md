I started coding on DS & Algorithm from my 3rd year of college.I have continued this habit till now.Of course ,it helps me in cracking interviews.But it's more than that to me.I have started treating these problems like a crossword /sudoko puzzle.I enjoy them until I get stuck on single problem for days ;).It's my brain Gym!!
